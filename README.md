## Domain of Interest

-   Why are you interested in this field/domain?
-   What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
-   What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

## Finding Data

(identify and download at least 3 sources of data)

For each source of data, provide the following information:

-   Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
-   How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
-   How many observations (rows) are in your data? 
-   How many features (columns) are in the data?
-   What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

### Data 1 - Suicide Mortality by State

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/suicide-mortality/suicide.htm

The data was collected from 3000+ local jurisdictions and each city, county, and state determines the data to share with the CDC. However, the CDC plays a neutral role as the reporting is conducted by local jurisdictions.
There are 400 rows within this dataset from the CDC.
There are 5 columns, but one is a URL and does not contain specific data about the state/year/suicide/death count
This dataset could be merged with economic trends by year to answer how the state of economy influences suicide rates. Other datasets merged with this one could show causal factors for suicide propensity such as technological access, GDP, homelessness, and much more.
